My 31st assignment! The purpose of this assignment was to begin using Figma to explore UI and UX principles. I researched the functionality of a product registration page and determined what would be the most annoying things I could envision a customer running into. The main goal then became to design a product registration page that did its best to eliminate as many of those things as possible, get them to fill out enough information, and press the register button. 

One of the things I personally run into with websites is how blinding white and bright many ones are due to trying to look clean and modern. There is definitely a place for that, but there is a reason I run dark mode at all opportunities and use dark reader across the web. My eyes feel vastly better the less pure white and more darker colors, to the point where without dark reader I likely wouldn't bother using a site. In this case I tried to pick a decent color scheme without burning my eyes and I am happy with how it came out. 

There are two wireframes that show both the mobile and desktop versions of the registration page, as well as two finished versions with the styles implemented. I am not used to this level of planning before developing, but it did help me make a much better site.
